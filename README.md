# Python Challenges #
## Who is this for? ##
This is for anyone who wants to try and practice python. The challenges can be done within a minute or the harder one require a bit more thought. Either way it's good scripting practice.   


## Requirements ##
All you need is python, if you're on linux open up a terminal and type  
`python`   
If you get something like the following you're good to start the challenges   
`
Python 3.6.5 (default, May 11 2018, 04:00:52) 
[GCC 8.1.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> `  

If you don't get something like the above then you will need to install python for example on Ubuntu all you need to do is   
`apt-get update & apt-get install python`  

If you're unlucky enough to be on windows then you will probably have to download and install python manually, for that you can follow a youtube video on the installaltion proccess, then come back here and follow this readme.   

## What version of python?
You can do these challenges in any language you want (within reason), therefore any version of Python is acceptible. Although the solutions (that i did not write) are wirrten in python version 2. I would recommend using Python version 3.*. The solutions used probably wont work if you're running python 3. To get arround this you should specifiy Python 2 in the terminal.  
`python2 Solution.py`  
To force the Python version as 3 you can just do the following.   
`python3 Solution.py`  

## Installation ##
To install just do the following commands  
`cd ~/Documents`   
`sudo git clone https://github.com/Hack-Hut/Python-Daily-Challenges.git `  
`cd Python-Daily-Challenges.git`  

## Why did I do this? ##
Duno got bored on the commute to work and wanted to improve on my python for work, as I needed a refresher.   


## Credit ##

I did not write these challenges. That credit goes to   
`https://github.com/zhiwehu`  
All I did was format the questions in a nice format, I did this using python and bash.
